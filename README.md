## About this Repository

Welcome to the Prompts for Education repository! Our mission is to transform the way educators and staff in K-12 and higher education institutions interact with generative AI technology like ChatGPT and Bing Chat.

### Disclaimer

While the prompts in this repository are designed with care and intended for educational use, users should be aware of potential risks in their application. Large Language Models (LLMs) may interpret prompts in ways that were not originally intended, leading to unexpected or inappropriate responses. We strongly encourage users to customize the prompts to fit their unique contexts, students, and needs, and to review the responses from LLMs for suitability and accuracy. Always exercise caution and professional judgment when incorporating these prompts into your educational environment.

### What's a Prompt?
